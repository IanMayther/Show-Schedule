# Show-Schedule
Show Install Schedule
The goal is to create a dynamic user interface that shows an install schedule.

Stage 1 - Basic Functionality:
The interface will reflect the current status of jobs due to install in a given time period.  There should be several view types- work week, month, year.  The interface will show instances of jobs due on those given days.  Jobs will come from a database that will be queried by the interface.  As the database is updated, and the interface is refreshed, any changes will show on the interface.

Stage 2 - Advanced Functionality:
Moving the due dates of the jobs will push back to the database. 

Stage 3 - Bells and Whistles:
Developing different queries to show different items like who the installer is, how many hours they have for the displayed time period, filtering by installer, displaying total scheduled revenue for the given time period.
